- support different font sizes in search list view rows
- clearing search highlight in large documents blocks GUI for too long
- main text: xview scrolling; yoff position with offset et.al.

clean-up:
- split search_list file? (3200 lines, 3 internal sub-classes)
  move undo/redo & bg tasks in umbrella class of search list view
- use signals instead of hard-wired callbacks to dialogs (static interfaces)
- split off duplicated "find" toolbar code into separate class
- MainText: limit access to QPlainText base class interface
- MainText: redesign keyCmdText() handler, esp. for numeric prefix
- ConfigFile: use QCommandLineParser class instead of legacy C code

optional enhancements:
- add text from manual page to help menu (e.g. load HTML manual page into QTextEdit)
- multiple instances of search list window
- bookmark undo/redo for line list (implemented within Bookmarks class)
- bookmark adding/removing via text search (all/all above/all below)
- search history dialog: max list length configurable
- file reload: offer changing load buffer size & mode limits
