- initial highlighting: mark-up visible equiv. to search HALL
- Highlighter::setList: restarts complete highlight init -> only newly added
- support different font sizes in search list view rows
- clearing search highlight in large documents blocks GUI for too long
- search_list: performance optimization line list used by SearchListModel

- add tool-tips
- add help (e.g. load HTML manual page into QTextEdit)
- command line options --head/--tail not used yet (i.e. no size limit yet)
- loading files in the background / at least after main window is open
- loading from pipe
- main text: xview scrolling; yoff position with offset et.al.
- main text: number prefix on key commands

clean-up:
- use signals instead of hard-wired callbacks to dialogs
- main_win: split RC file into separate class (?)
- main_search: split search history into separate class (?)
- undo/redo in separate class (?)
- split off duplicated "find" toolbar code into separate class
- limit access to MainText QPlainText base class interface

optional enhancements:
- multiple instances of search list window
- bookmark undo/redo for line list (implemented within Bookmarks class)
- bookmark adding/removing via text search (all/all above/all below)
- search history dialog: max list length configurable
